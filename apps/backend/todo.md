# Caveats

## Content Security Policy CSP TODO: still valid?
The API is enfocing full CSP which collides with inline scripts. We will force the create react app to not inline any scripts into the index.html by setting INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false
in package.json

https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration/


## Craco
As we are using Tailwind CSS for the app we needed to overwrite built in postcss/webpack configs. To be able to do that we've chosen https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco
